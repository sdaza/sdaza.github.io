I'm a data scientist, demographer, and sociologist working on industry and academic projects.

I received my Ph.D. in sociology from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/soc/) and my Bachelor's and Master's in Sociology from the [Catholic University of Chile](http://sociologia.uc.cl/). 

My **academic work** focuses on health disparities, the impact of the criminal justice system on health and social integration, and the connection between health inequalities and genetics. I use statistical and computational methods, with an emphasis on data science and agent-based modeling (ABM).

Currently, I'm a **Senior Data Scientist** at [DocPlanner](https://www.docplanner.com/) and collaborate with the [Center for the Study of Justice and Society](http://justiciaysociedad.uc.cl/) at the Catholic University of Chile and [Fundación Colunga](https://www.fundacioncolunga.org/).
