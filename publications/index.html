      <p>Despite substantial research, drivers of the widening gap in life expectancy between rich and poor in the U.S. – the so-called longevity gap – remain unknown. Recent research has suggested that contextual income mobility (e.g., county-level socioeconomic mobility) may play an essential role in explaining the longevity gap.  Previous studies – based mostly on aggregate and cross-sectional individual data – show an association between county income mobility and county mortality and individual’s health. However, inferring individual effects from aggregate (county-level) data can be problematic (i.e., ecological fallacy), and measuring exposure to income mobility using the county where respondents currently live or die, might overlook the selection process associated with residential mobility. This paper aims to extend previous research by estimating the effect of average exposure to mobility regimes during childhood and adolescence on adult health using longitudinal data and accounting for selection into counties over time (i.e., residential mobility). We use both the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with geocoded data to assess the link between county-level income mobility (Chetty’s estimates), behaviors (smoking) and health conditions and status (self-reported health, BMI, depressive symptoms). Furthermore, we use cohorts optimally match Chetty’s estimates of income mobility in the U.S. (1980-1982) and account for selection and time-varying confounders using marginal structural models (MSM). Overall, we provide a more precise test of the hypothesis that childhood exposure to income mobility regimes may determine health status through behavior (i.e., smoking) later in life and contribute to longevity gaps.</p>

      <p>Some scholars have recently suggested that contextual income mobility –- defined as individuals’ ability to exceed their parents’ income within the place of residence — may play an essential role in explaining health disparities in the U.S.  Previous research provides some evidence for the link between the rigidity of the stratification system and health. This paper proposes an agent-based model to formalize, explore, and describe the dynamic between a place’s income mobility and health. By combining empirical information and using an exploratory model, we first assess the population-level consequences of changes in income mobility effects and regime for health (life expectancy). We then examine under which residential mobility conditions, and data collection and modeling strategies we can retrieve the effect of income mobility on mortality.</p>

      <p>Life course criminology has long argued that having a job may act as a turning point in trajectories of offending, moving individuals toward conventional activities. However, while finding and keeping a job are considered one of the key challenges inmates face as they move back into society, there is limited research on the dynamics and trajectories of post-prison employment. Little is also know about whether work characteristics and its relation to crime affect employment trajectories following release. Using data from the study “Reintegration, desistance and recidivism among female inmates in Chile” (RDFC), our paper describes trajectories of employment among a cohort of 225 women released from prison in Santiago, Chile and followed during the first year after release. We use sequence analysis to explore monthly patterns of employment considering different types of work (i.e., self-employed / employed, legitimate / under-the- table). To better account for the complex relationship between work and crime, we include offending as another type of income-generating activity. Finally, we use cluster analysis and regression models to explore which individual characteristics are associated with employment and offending trajectories.  Our results show a significant level of heterogeneity in employment trajectories by job type, and the importance of considering work and offending to obtain a more complete picture of the dynamics of employment during reentry.</p>

      <p>We propose simple techniques to account for uncertainty of estimates of adult mortality indicators into statistical analyses. We consider two dimensions of uncertainty: errors due to violation of assumptions on which estimates are based and probability of departures from assumptions in a particular empirical case. We use simulations to estimate the entire distribution of errors of selected indirect estimates of adult mortality due to violations of some or a combination of assumptions on which the methods rely. We then describe strategies to assess the validity of some or a combination of assumptions in empirical cases and, finally, propose methods to combine knowledge about estimates’ errors and exogenous information about validity of assumptions. As an illustration we use the classic problem of identification of effects of improvements of living standards and medical technology on secular mortality decline. In addition, we introduce model uncertainty and assess its effects on inferences when occurring jointly with adult mortality estimates uncertainty. We then compare our results with those from standard practice that ignore imprecision of estimates and alternative choices of model. Although the techniques introduced here are designed to facilitate analysis of mortality estimates in countries with deficient statistics, they are quite general and could be generalized to other applications.</p>

      <p>Previous research suggests that incarceration has negative implications for individuals’ well-being, health, and mortality. Most of these studies, though, do not follow former prisoners over extended periods of time and into older adult ages when it  is more likely  that cumulative consequences  of incarceration will be felt. This paper contributes to this literature by employing for the first time the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the long run association between individual incarceration and mortality over nearly 40 years, and supplementing those analyses with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). We then use these estimates to investigate the implications of the US incarceration regime and the post-1980 incarceration boom for the US health and mortality disadvantage relative to industrialized peer countries (the United Kingdom).</p>

      <p>The last decades’ increase in female incarceration has translated into an increasing number of women being released from prison. Understanding their characteristics and criminal trajectories can enlighten us regarding the different needs of women upon re-entering society after incarceration. Drawing on data from the Reinserción, Desistimiento y Reincidencia en Mujeres Privadas de Libertad en Chile study, this article identifies different profiles among a cohort of 225 women who were released from prison in Santiago, Chile, and demonstrates that significant heterogeneity exists among them in terms of their criminal trajectories and the intervention needs to support their transition out of prison.</p>

      <p>Background: Despite substantial research, the causes of the widening gap in life expectancy between rich and poor Americans—the longevity gap— remain unknown. We hypothesized that social mobility may play an important role in explaining the longevity gap. Methods: We estimated the association between social mobility - here operationalized as the correlation between parent and child income - and life expectancy at age 40 among U.S. men and women in different income quartiles using newly available county-level data, adjusting for a range of economic, social, and demographic characteristics. We used these estimates to predict the longevity gap between the top and bottom income quartiles if all counties had the same social mobility as the best performing county. Results: In our sample of 1,559 counties (representing 93% of the U.S. population), each increase of 1 standard deviation in the social mobility measure was associated with a 0.38 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.47) and 0.29 year (95% CI: 0.21, 0.38) increase in life expectancy among bottom income quartile men and women, respectively. Estimates for the top income quartile were smaller, and not robust to covariate adjustment. If all counties had the highest level of social mobility, the predicted longevity gap between the lowest and highest income quartiles would be smaller by 1.4 years for men (95% CI: 0.7, 2.1) and 1.1 years (95% CI: 0.5,1.6) for women, representing a 20% decrease. Conclusion: Social mobility may explain an important portion of incomerelated life expectancy gaps in the United States.</p>

      <p>Background: There is mounting evidence for a recent increase of social disparities in chronicdisease prevalence and mortality. However, little is known about how these trends are reflected incombined measures of morbidity, disability and mortality. Method: We use two nationally representative surveys of the Spanish population for the years 2008 to 2017 and standard measures of expected duration of disability and illness to assess timetrends and social disparities in mortality, morbidity and expected years lived in disability (DFLE) and with chronic illness (chrDFLE). We provide empirical evidence of shifting trends for thesemeasures. We then decompose these changes into contributions associated with disability, chronicillness and mortality. Finally, we estimate the size of education differentials in DFLE and chrDFLEand evaluate the magnitude and direction of changes of these differentials over time. Results: While the disability based indicator suggests a decrease of expected years withoutdisability for both men and women (expansion of morbidity), the morbidity based indicator showsan increase in time spend free of chronic disease for women but a slight decrease for men. The decrease in time spent without disability was observed for all education groups but is particularlymarked for those with low education. Conclusion: We find evidence of an expansion of morbidity in Spain between 2008 and 2017. The bulk of this development is related to increases in time spent with functional limitations overthis period. These patterns occur in conjuncture with growing social disparities in time spend withchronic illness or disability.</p>

      <p>Although agent-based models (ABMs) have been increasingly accepted in social sciences as a valid tool to formalize theory, propose mechanisms able to recreate regularities, and guide empirical research, we are not aware of any research using ABMs to assess the robustness of our statistical methods. We argue that ABMs can be extremely helpful to assess models when the phenomena under study are complex. As an example, we create an ABM to evaluate the estimation of selection and influence effects by SIENA, a stochastic actor-oriented model proposed by Tom A. B. Snijders and colleagues. It is a prominent network analysis method that has gained popularity during the last 10 years and been applied to estimate selection and influence for a broad range of behaviors and traits such as substance use, delinquency, violence, health, and educational attainment. However, we know little about the conditions for which this method is reliable or the particular biases it might have. The results from our analysis show that selection and influence are estimated by SIENA asymmetrically and that, with very simple assumptions, we can generate data where selection estimates are highly sensitive to misspecification, suggesting caution when interpreting SIENA analyses.</p>

      <p>We assess the magnitude of the association between intergenerational income mobility and US adult mortality by gender, age group, race/ethnicity and the causes of death. We use a data set from The Health Inequality Project and CDC mortality data at the county level. We find that under different model specifications the association between income mobility and adult mortality is strong, properly signed, and consistent with our hypotheses. If the association we find reflects a causal effect it would translate into shifts in life expectancy at age 40 of as much as 2.0-4.8 years among males and 0.1-2.0 among females, equivalent to 5.1-12.5 and 0.2-4.7 percent of the U.S. male and female life expectancy at age 40 respectively. On average, these effects are 1.5 to 2.5 times as large as those of income inequality and represent between 40 (males) and 25 (females) percent of the magnitude of an income shift from the lowest to the highest quartile of the U.S. income distribution.</p>

      <p>This paper uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) and recent empirical strategies to examine the dynamic consequences of parenthood on delinquency and substance use. We take advantage of the miscarriage information available to form comparison groups. Our contribution is to extend the analysis of the effects of childbearing to deviant outcomes such as delinquency and substance use, and explore the  differences between motherhood and fatherhood. Our preliminary results suggest reductions in risky behaviors from childbearing. We do not find evidence of heterogeneity across socioeconomic status.</p>

      <p>Through a telephone survey, nationally representative of the Chilean adult population, we study the determinants of electoral choice in the first round of the 2009-2010 national election – which granted power to the political right (Alianza por Chile coalition) after two decades of dominance of center-left governments (Concertación por la Democracia coalition). Age differences and the egotropic vote explain the two main “leaks” of votes suffered by the Concertación candidate Eduardo Frei towards his contenders. Younger voters leaned towards the independent leftist candidate Marco Enríquez Ominami, and economically unsatisfied voters did so towards the rightist candidate Sebastián Piñera. We also show that the vote in the 1988 plebiscite still shapes the vote in 2009-2010, but more strongly among the upper classes than among the lower classes. We suggest this results from the stronger involvement of the former in the political conflict around the military regime.</p>
