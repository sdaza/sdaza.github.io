    <p>Although agent-based models (ABMs) have been increasingly accepted in social sciences as a valid tool to formalize theory, propose mechanisms able to recreate regularities, and guide empirical research, we are not aware of any research using ABMs to assess the robustness of our statistical methods. We argue that ABMs can be extremely helpful to assess models when the phenomena under study are complex. As an example, we create an ABM to evaluate the estimation of selection and influence effects by SIENA, a stochastic actor-oriented model proposed by Tom A. B. Snijders and colleagues. It is a prominent network analysis method that has gained popularity during the last 10 years and been applied to estimate selection and influence for a broad range of behaviors and traits such as substance use, delinquency, violence, health, and educational attainment. However, we know little about the conditions for which this method is reliable or the particular biases it might have. The results from our analysis show that selection and influence are estimated by SIENA asymmetrically and that, with very simple assumptions, we can generate data where selection estimates are highly sensitive to misspecification, suggesting caution when interpreting SIENA analyses.</p>

    <p>Background: Despite substantial research, the causes of the widening
gap in life expectancy between rich and poor Americans—the longevity
gap— remain unknown. We hypothesized that social mobility may play
an important role in explaining the longevity gap.

Methods: We estimated the association between social mobility - here
operationalized as the correlation between parent and child income - and
life expectancy at age 40 among U.S. men and women in different
income quartiles using newly available county-level data, adjusting for a
range of economic, social, and demographic characteristics. We used
these estimates to predict the longevity gap between the top and bottom
income quartiles if all counties had the same social mobility as the best
performing county.

Results: In our sample of 1,559 counties (representing 93% of the U.S.
population), each increase of 1 standard deviation in the social mobility
measure was associated with a 0.38 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.47) and 0.29 year
(95% CI: 0.21, 0.38) increase in life expectancy among bottom income
quartile men and women, respectively. Estimates for the top income
quartile were smaller, and not robust to covariate adjustment. If all
counties had the highest level of social mobility, the predicted longevity
gap between the lowest and highest income quartiles would be smaller
by 1.4 years for men (95% CI: 0.7, 2.1) and 1.1 years (95% CI:
0.5,1.6) for women, representing a 20% decrease.

Conclusion: Social mobility may explain an important portion of incomerelated life expectancy gaps in the United States.</p>

    <p>We propose simple techniques to account for uncertainty of estimates of adult mortality indicators into statistical analyses. We consider two dimensions of uncertainty: errors due to violation of assumptions on which estimates are based and probability of departures from assumptions in a particular empirical case. We use simulations to estimate the entire distribution of errors of selected indirect estimates of adult mortality due to violations of some or a combination of assumptions on which the methods rely. We then describe strategies to assess the validity of some or a combination of assumptions in empirical cases and, finally, propose methods to combine knowledge about estimates’ errors and exogenous information about validity of assumptions. As an illustration we use the classic problem of identification of effects of improvements of living standards and medical technology on secular mortality decline. In addition, we introduce model uncertainty and assess its effects on inferences when occurring jointly with adult mortality estimates uncertainty. We then compare our results with those from standard practice that ignore imprecision of estimates and alternative choices of model. Although the techniques introduced here are designed to facilitate analysis of mortality estimates in countries with deficient statistics, they are quite general and could be generalized to other applications.</p>

    <p>We assess the magnitude of the association between intergenerational income mobility and US adult mortality by gender, age group, race/ethnicity and the causes of death. We use a data set from The Health Inequality Project and CDC mortality data at the county level. We find that under different model specifications the association between income mobility and adult mortality is strong, properly signed, and consistent with our hypotheses. If the association we find reflects a causal effect it would translate into shifts in life expectancy at age 40 of as much as 2.0-4.8 years among males and 0.1-2.0 among females, equivalent to 5.1-12.5 and 0.2-4.7 percent of the U.S. male and female life expectancy at age 40 respectively. On average, these effects are 1.5 to 2.5 times as large as those of income inequality and represent between 40 (males) and 25 (females) percent of the magnitude of an income shift from the lowest to the highest quartile of the U.S. income distribution.</p>

    <p>Previous research suggests that incarceration has negative implications for individuals’ well-being, health, and mortality. These studies, however, are limited because they do not follow former prisoners over extended periods of time into older adult ages when the brunt of incarceration effects may be felt. This paper contributes to this literature by employing the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate long-term effects of individual incarceration on mortality over a period of nearly 40 years. We use these estimates to investigate the implications of the US incarceration regime and the post-1980 incarceration boom for the US health and mortality disadvantage relative to industrialized peer countries (the United Kingdom).</p>

We take advantage of the miscarriage information available to form comparison groups. Our contribution is to extend the analysis of the effects of childbearing to deviant outcomes such as delinquency and substance use, and explore the  differences between motherhood and fatherhood.

    <p>Through a telephone survey, nationally representative of the Chilean adult population, we study the determinants of
electoral choice in the first round of the 2009-2010 national election – which granted power to the political right (Alianza por Chile coalition) after two decades of dominance of center-left governments (Concertación por la Democracia coalition). Age differences and the egotropic vote explain the
two main “leaks” of votes suffered by the Concertación candidate Eduardo Frei towards his contenders. Younger
voters leaned towards the independent leftist candidate Marco Enríquez Ominami, and economically unsatisfied
voters did so towards the rightist candidate Sebastián Piñera.
We also show that the vote in the 1988 plebiscite still shapes
the vote in 2009-2010, but more strongly among the upper
classes than among the lower classes. We suggest this results
from the stronger involvement of the former in the political
conflict around the military regime.</p>
